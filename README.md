## Summary

What if a 25% U.S. tariff reshaped the global auto industry? This RStudio Shiny app, built with AI collaboration (Grok 3 by xAI) and deployed on Shinyapps.io, dives into that question. Focusing on Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Canada—key players in U.S. auto imports—it tracks how tariffs on steel, rubber, plastics, semiconductors, and components ripple through costs, GDP, and jobs over 60 months. With adjustable tariffs, job impact plots, and stock exchange logos (JPX, KOSPI, BMV, TSX), it’s a tool for economists, policymakers, and industry leaders to explore supply chain resilience in real time.

## Installation

To run locally:
1. Install R (4.0.0+ recommended).
2. Install required packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("shiny", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "plotly", "DT", "writexl"))
   ```
3. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoSupplyChainImpact.git
   ```
4. Ensure the `www` folder with logos (`jpx-logo.png`, `kospi-logo.png`, `bmv-logo.png`, `tsx-logo.png`) is in the repo root.
5. Run in RStudio:
   ```R
   shiny::runApp("path/to/AutoSupplyChainImpact")
   ```

## Usage

- **Tariff Adjustments**: Use sliders to set tariffs (0-50%) for steel, rubber, plastics, semiconductors, and components—or pick presets like "25% Universal."
- **Timeline**: Slide from 12 to 60 months to project impacts.
- **Tabs**:
  - **Material Cost Impact**: See cost increases in millions USD.
  - **GDP Impact**: Track percentage GDP changes.
  - **Job Impact**: Visualize job gains/losses (e.g., 60 jobs per $1M in South Korea).
  - **Data Table**: Summarize costs, GDP, and jobs, exportable to CSV.
  - **Popular Car Companies**: View top automakers with stock exchange logos.
- **Export**: Download data as `supply_chain_impact_[date].csv`.

## Why This Matters

This app matters because tariffs—like a potential 25% U.S. levy—could reshape the $250B+ auto trade with Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Canada. For Japan (3% GDP from autos), a $5B cost hike could cut 250,000 jobs. South Korea’s 10% auto-driven GDP faces even steeper risks—$4B might mean 240,000 jobs lost. Mexico’s $181B export hub and Canada’s $36B trade with the U.S. hang in the balance, with ripple effects on steel, tech, and rubber industries. Economists get data-driven forecasts, policymakers see GDP stakes, and humanitarians (e.g., Red Cross) grasp job impacts. Built with AI, it’s a bridge between trade theory and real-world outcomes—vital as global supply chains face disruption.

## Conclusion

Deployed on Shinyapps.io, `AutoSupplyChainImpact` showcases a blend of R programming, economic modeling, and AI ingenuity (thanks, Grok 3!). It’s a case study in tariff effects—material costs, GDP shifts, job impacts—visualized with stock exchange logos for flair. Next steps could include real-time data or environmental metrics. This repo stands as a GitHub-ready testament to tackling complex problems with interactive tools.
